Please be aware that whether or not learners in your setting are ready for projects in their year will depend on their prior experience.

The placement of some of the projects in particular year groups is arbitrary: the National Curriculm only defines outcomes for the whole of Key Stages 1 and 2, not for each individual year group. **Do the projects that are right for you.**
