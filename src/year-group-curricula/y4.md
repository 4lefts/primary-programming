title: Year 4
---

Pupils:

- create and **debug** programs
- begin to work with **variables** - in Year 4, these will be used to store **data** that is useful to their program, such as scores, lives, or timers. These go hand in hand with repetition and selection
- use **sequencing** and **repetition** - this builds on Year 3 and involves children beginning to use loops that may end based on a condition (for example, when a timer variable reaches zero)
- begin to use **selection** - in conjuction with sequencing, children begin to use **if** statements to make something happen (or stop something happening) in their program, when a **confidition** is met
- refine algorithms to improve **efficiency** - in this context, by using loops rather than unnecessarily long sequences of instructions
- begin to explore and notice the similarities and differences between programming languages and use this knowledge to help them create and debug programs efficiently
