Building on Year 4...

- Pupils create, deconstruct and refine programs to accomplish specific goals.
- They can:
  - use **selection** within programs more explicitly. This builds on Years 3 and 4, for example by checking **if** a user's answer is correct in the multiplication game
  - improve efficiency - children should have the opportunity to explore different implementations of similar algorithms and recognise that some are more efficient than others (e.g. using `repeat` blocks rather that huge numbers of `move` or `rotate` blocks)
  - use a range of simple inputs and outputs to control or simulate physical systems, including using random numbers, and begin to explore constraining these systems. For example:
    - to create random maths questions,
    - to simulate forces such as wind or gravity
    - to create more realistic bounces of balls on a bat in a tenis game)
- Pupils use logical reasoning to explain how some algorithms work and to detect and correct errors in programs.
- They independently employ strategies to solve problems.
