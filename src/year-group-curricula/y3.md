Pupils:

- create and **debug** programs
- use **sequencing** - in this context, creating a program that runs step-by-step to achieve a specific goal
- **decompose** problems both on and off screen - they can break problems down into smaller pieces in order to program them
- begin to use simple **repetition** - without the use of variables, this will only be used to repeat a part of a program a set number of times, for example, using a `repeat` block in Scratch
- use the principles of logical reasoning in order to resolve problems
