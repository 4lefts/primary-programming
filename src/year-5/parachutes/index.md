In this project, children will make a game called Parachute Drop. The skydiver needs to get to the ground without hitting any of the clouds.

In this project, children will review prior work on **variables**, and begin to explore how physical systems can be modelled in code. The variables are use here to model forces such as the wind and gravity, which act on the clouds and the skydiver.

They will continue to use **selection** and will explore other ways that it is used, for example with **inputs** (i.e. `if a key is pressed`), and begin to use it with **iteration** to position the clouds at the start of the game.

This project assumes a level of Scratch knowledge that builds on the knowledge covered in the Year 4 project, including how to create sprites and add code to them, how to create backgrounds, and how to load, save, and (if using Scratch accounts) remix projects shared via a studio. If children are saving work locally to their computers, then there will need to be a way to share a Scratch project with them.

## 1. Predict

First, children should have the opportunity to read the code. Remind children that code can be read as a story, they can step through it logically, one block at a time, and read it out loud. If they do this, it will almost always make sense.

First, the game itself looks like this - can anyone predict how it works or what the idea is?
